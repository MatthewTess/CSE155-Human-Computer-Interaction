# CSE155-Human-Computer-Interaction
<br> Unity version 2021.3.16f1 or later needed; also need a mic and webcam
<br> Gaze calibration can be inconsistent, use eye gaze to move the cursor and say 'select' to act as a left click
<br> If there are any issues or missing files please let me know, some files have been deleted/optimized as Untiy will rebuild the library and other folders upon initial project build
