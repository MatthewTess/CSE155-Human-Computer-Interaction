# CSE155-Human-Computer-Interaction
<br> -Unity version 2021.3.16f1 or later needed; also need a mic and webcam  
<br> -Gaze calibration can be inconsistent; use eye gaze to move the cursor and say 'select' to act as a left click  
<br> -If there are any issues or missing files, please let me know. Some files have been deleted/optimized as Untiy will rebuild the library and other folders upon initial project build  
<br> -Collaborated with John, Luis, and Dathan. I worked on optimizing gaze/calibration files, added some rooms/scenes, and assisted in the implementation of voice recognition code
